# Fitness Tracker

# Description

For our week 18 assignment, we had to create an application that could track workouts and fitness goals for a user.

Name: Fitness Tracker

We were provided the front-end code for the application and our objective was to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

The application will allow the user to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercises; and for cardio workouts, track the distance traveled.
